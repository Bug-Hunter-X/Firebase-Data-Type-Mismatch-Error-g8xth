This repository demonstrates a common, yet often difficult-to-debug, error in Firebase applications: data type mismatches. The `bug.js` file showcases code that attempts to access data of an unexpected type, leading to an error.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a robust solution that addresses this issue through rigorous type checking and error handling.  This example is particularly useful for developers new to Firebase or those who have experienced mysterious runtime crashes related to data types.
